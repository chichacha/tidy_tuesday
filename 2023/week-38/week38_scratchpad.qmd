### What sort of Executable Cells Can I enter?

```         
If I'm using visual editor, from Insert I can insert  
R, Python, Bash, Rcpp, SQL, D3, Stan, Julia , Mermaid, GraphViz
```

### Ooohh! I can even enter GraphViz!

{dot} will let me enter GraphViz!

```{dot}
digraph LearningProcess {
  node [shape=box, style=filled, color="#264653", fontname="Roboto Condensed"];
  
  subgraph cluster_language {
    label="Learning Language (Because Speaking Gibberish is Fun!)";
    Learning -> Play -> FailALot -> Practice -> Mastery;
  }
  
  subgraph cluster_technology {
    label="Learning Technology (Because Breaking Stuff is a Hobby!)";
    Learning -> Play -> FailALot -> Experiment -> Proficiency;
  }
  
  Learning [label="Learn", shape=ellipse, color="#2a9d8f"];
  Play [label="Play", shape=ellipse, color="#2a9d8f"];
  FailALot [label="Fail A Lot", shape=ellipse, color="#e76f51"];
  Practice [label="Practice", shape=ellipse, color="#2a9d8f"];
  Mastery [label="Mastery", shape=ellipse, color="#2a9d8f"];
  Experiment [label="Experiment", shape=ellipse, color="#2a9d8f"];
  Proficiency [label="Proficiency", shape=ellipse, color="#2a9d8f"];
}

```

{mermaid} will let me enter Mermaid too. 
Mermaid is often used with Markdown-based documents, and it is suitable for Simple Diagram. 

```{mermaid}
graph LR;
  Learning[Start Learning] -->|Confusion| Frustration[Frustration];
  Frustration -->|Breakdown| Breakdown[Breakdown];
  Breakdown -->|Google Everything| Google[Google Everything];
  Breakdown -->|Caffeine Overdose| Caffeine[Caffeine Overdose];
  Breakdown -->|Procrastination| Procrastination[Procrastination];
  Google -->|Repeat| Repeat[Repeat Steps 1-7];
  Caffeine -->|Repeat| Repeat;
  Procrastination -->|Repeat| Repeat;
  Repeat -->|Repeat| Learning;
  Repeat -->|Eventually| Success[Success!];


```
